Simple graphics library by Mark Gentles

This is a small project of mine that focuses on graphics technology. I'm using this as a learning experience to further my understanding of graphics rendering and game logic.
AS such, there are (many) places in the code that could be done by third party tools, but then i wouldn't understand the nuances of how those tools worked in the first place!
